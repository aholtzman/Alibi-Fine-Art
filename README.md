## Final Website for Alibi Fine Art
### A fine art photography gallery located in Chicago, IL operated from 2010 until 2017

This is the fourth iteration of the Alibi Fine Art gallery website. While the gallery was active I designed, built and maintained the site with Adobe Muse updating with each new artist and exhibition, happening every two month on average with two major designs/builds during this period. Upon closing in the summer of 2017 I created an HTML & CSS legacy [page](https://github.com/aholtzman/Alibi-Fine-Art-HTML) that was used as the design basis for this version. This was built with React upon the create-react-app structure.
